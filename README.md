# 📊 Markets in Motion  
**Analyzing the Impact of CPI and FOMC News on Crypto and U.S. Tech Stocks**

---

## 📌 Overview

Crypto assets and U.S. tech stocks are highly sensitive to macroeconomic announcements — especially:
- 📈 CPI (Consumer Price Index)
- 🏦 FOMC (Federal Reserve interest rate decisions)

This project explores how these economic events affect market behavior across:
- **Cryptocurrencies**: BTC (Bitcoin), ETH (Ethereum)
- **U.S. Tech Stocks**: AAPL (Apple), TSLA (Tesla), NVDA (Nvidia)

We analyze:
- Daily return & volatility ±3 days before/after macro events
- Price reactions and correlation shifts
- Institutional vs retail-driven response patterns

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `yfinance`, `plotly`
- Data Sources:
  - Historical prices: CoinGecko API, Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
  - Macro events: `tradingeconomics.com`, manually compiled

## 📊 Key Analysis

### 🔹 Market Behavior Around Events
- BTC and ETH showed stronger volatility spikes around CPI release dates, especially when inflation data was unexpected.
- Tech stocks (AAPL, TSLA, NVDA) were more sensitive to FOMC decisions, showing delayed but clearer directional movement.

### 🔹 Correlation Shift
- Asset correlations increased after CPI/FOMC events — indicating synchronized market behavior during uncertainty.

### 🔹 Return & Volatility Summary

| Asset | Avg Return (CPI Day) | Avg Return (FOMC Day) |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|
| BTC   | +1.4%                | +2.0%                  |
| ETH   | +1.1%                | +1.8%                  |
| AAPL  | -0.2%                | +0.5%                  |
| TSLA  | +0.3%                | +1.2%                  |
| NVDA  | +0.4%                | +1.0%                  |

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Crypto reacts faster and more emotionally to CPI news (retail-driven).
- Tech stocks respond more cleanly to FOMC decisions, possibly due to institutional dominance.
- Volatility is opportunity — post-event breakout patterns are useful for short-term traders.
